# ClaudeSkills

ClaudeSkills is a collection of Agent Skills: 13 skill packages written in the open `SKILL.md` format. Each skill packages the complete process for getting something done — steps, templates, scripts, examples, and acceptance checks are all files — and installs into any client that supports Agent Skills.

A prompt lets a model do something once, then dies with the conversation; a skill keeps the method around, so it can be reused, inspected, and improved.

## Quick start

Install one and try it — deck-studio, for example:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/staruhub/ClaudeSkills.git && cd ClaudeSkills
python3 scripts/install_skill.py deck-studio
```

Then just tell your agent:

```text
Use deck-studio to turn this quarterly review into an 8-slide consulting deck
```

Skills install to `~/.agents/skills/` by default, which most clients scan. For other ways to install, see [Install options](#install-options).

## Skills

Four flagships:

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| [`deep-research`](skills/Geek-skills-deep-research/SKILL.md) | Research: scopes the question, gathers sources, registers each one, checks citations; hands back a report with references and limits |
| [`product-manager`](skills/Geek-skills-product-manager/SKILL.md) | grill-me-to-doc: reads the repo first, asks one question per round, turns a vague idea into a product document. No code before the doc is approved; interruptions resume |
| [`deck-studio`](skills/Geek-skills-deck-studio/SKILL.md) | Decks: outline, per-page briefs, registered layouts, visual checks; delivers content or per-slide visuals |
| [`wechat-article-writer`](skills/Geek-skills-wechat-article-writer/SKILL.md) | WeChat articles: copy, image prompts, layout HTML — solo or as a pipeline. Never publishes for you |

Nine professional skills:

<details>

| [`pair-programming`](skills/Geek-skills-pair-programming/SKILL.md) | Writes code with structured self-review aimed at common AI-code defects |
| [`security-audit`](skills/Geek-skills-security-audit/SKILL.md) | Reviews code and dependencies for security issues |

</details>

Experimental ones (exam prep, weather reports, podcast generation, and friends) live in [`lab/`](lab/). They don't count toward the curated set and skip the same checks.

## Verification

Everything checkable is a script — run them yourself:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate.py                  # structure checks for the 13 curated skills
python3 scripts/run_routing_evals.py         # 91 routing cases
python3 tests/task_b/run_contract_tests.py   # 17 contract cases across the four flagships
```

You can also inspect the artifacts directly. deck-studio keeps its generators, rendered pages, rubrics, and review notes in the repo. Four of the 17 styles:

</p>

Examples: [Constructivist](skills/Geek-skills-deck-studio/examples/constructivist-design-constitution/) · [Moshiro consulting report](skills/Geek-skills-deck-studio/examples/moshiro-consulting-report/) · [Yinghuang bootcamp proposal](skills/Geek-skills-deck-studio/examples/yinghuang-bootcamp-proposal/) · [Polar Night AI Native](skills/Geek-skills-deck-studio/examples/polar-night-ai-native/)

Self-test scores: the Constructivist example scored **7.1/10** on the repo's own rubric; a position-swapped three-judge comparison came out **42.3** to **29.7**. The process and data are in the repo — rerun them yourself.

<details>
<summary><b>What each check proves, and what it doesn't</b></summary>

| Check | Proves | Doesn't prove |
|---|---|---|
| `run_contract_tests.py` | 17 fixed cases covering the success, resume, and failure paths of all four flagships; Deck additionally runs real Chrome rendering and PPTX assembly | Output quality on a different model, real image generation, actual WeChat publishing |
| `validate.py` | Directory structure of the 13 curated skills matches the repo contract | Real-business E2E for every skill |
| `run_routing_evals.py` | Schema, target, uniqueness, and conflict checks pass for 91 routing cases across 10 skills | Routing accuracy when a real model runs it |
| Python / Node compile checks | The repo's 13 Python files and 7 JavaScript files all parse | Network, external tools, production availability |

<summary><b>Show them</b></summary>

```bash
python3 scripts/install_skill.py --list                  # list all short names
python3 scripts/install_skill.py deep-research           # install any skill
python3 scripts/install_skill.py deep-research --project # current project only
python3 scripts/install_skill.py deep-research --client claude-code # Claude Code's directory
cp -r skills/Geek-skills-deep-research ~/.agents/skills/deep-research # manual copy; the directory name is the skill name
```

```bash
git pull && python3 scripts/install_skill.py deck-studio --force   # update
rm -rf ~/.agents/skills/deck-studio                                # uninstall
```

FAQ:

- Installed but not found: check whether your client scans `.agents/skills/`; if not, use its native directory.
- No automatic trigger: name the skill in your request. Triggers vary by client — some match natural language, others want slash commands.
- Re-install after `git pull` — installed skills are copies.
